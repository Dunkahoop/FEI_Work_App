# FEI Work App for Android

I made this as a small exercise, as well as a useful tool for my work. I work irregularly as an IT guy at a solar panel installation company (FEI) and I need to write down how many hours I've worked. One of the things I need to add is a decimal count of hours worked, which I have to either calculate manually or use [this online tool](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/time/hours.php). My goal was to do this locally on my phone, as I may not have time to write it down, but plug it into a note on my phone and add it later. This should help expedite the process.

The bottom of the screen shows the day 5 business days from now. I cash my paychecks using a mobile banking app, and I have to hold onto my checks for 5 business days. This shows the date for me without having to figure it out myself. I plan on making a widget that will show this date someday.
